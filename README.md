# ResNet-CIFAR10-Analysis

# Mini-Project Summary: ResNet Model on CIFAR10 Dataset

## Objective:
The objective of this mini-project is to develop a ResNet (Residual Network) model from scratch based on the specified architecture on the CIFAR10 dataset. The project aims to implement the ResNet architecture with convolutional layers using a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and padding set to "same," while also saving the trained model for future use.


## Details:

### ResNet Model Architecture
- **Description:** Developed a ResNet model with a specified architecture and hyperparameters on the CIFAR10 dataset.
- **Residual Network:** Implemented the ResNet architecture using convolutional layers with a kernel size of 3, stride of 1, and padding set to "same."
- **Model Training:** Trained the ResNet model on the CIFAR10 dataset to learn and classify images across multiple classes.
- **Save Trained Model:** Saved the trained ResNet model after training, ensuring that the model file is not included in the submission.

## Conclusion:
This mini-project showcases the development and analysis of a ResNet model on the CIFAR10 dataset, highlighting the architecture, model training process, and the importance of saving the trained model for future deployment and use cases.
